          <p><em>written on 01/12/2019. The loneliest birthday ever.</em></p>
<p>Time flies<br>I just feel like I am still about 18 years old . haha😀</p>
<p>have encountered a lot of difficulties suffering me  recently.<br>I am that kind of person who does not like to talk to others or to friends about troubles (although no friends around -. -). Even if previous difficult things have already passed, and I could take on by myself. But recently they have been very concentrated. My studies, emotions, plans, and work have been disturbing one after another. As a result,  collapsed. Then becoming irritable , volatile, mean, and extreme, and easily hurt people around me. These difficult things can certainly be solved in the end. I know I could solve it, anyway. But it can really affect my life, my emotions, and my thinking at this moment. And no way out. </p>
<p>When I was in China, I  was always wondering whether the difficulties I faced at that time were the hardest in my life? It seemed not.<br>Looking out the window of a certain moment, the weather in Guangzhou was as quiet as ever, and the air was not be much polluted. During that time, there was often a particularly devastating moment, and an idea emerged: “If I jump out of the window, maybe would really get relieved. Death maybe is a very good relief.” I was going to suicide then. At that time, another rationality in my head was advising me. “There are still many possibilities in the future, and everything would be “だいじょうぶ.”” But I found that I couldn’t jump out of the window, because that kind of death would be really ugly. I can’t go die in that way…My despair and pain at that time reached the pinnacle of my life. It turns out that there will be a point where you can’t die but you really want to die. I was being miserable for a few months in the mental torture that I wanted to die and couldn’t. Later, I quit my job and began to prepare to go to NZ. Therefore, cheer on myself every day after that. I believe that no matter how tough I am, it won’t be more tougher than that time.</p>
<p>I have often thought about giving up, giving up a lot of things. Like I could go back to my previous life and live a simple life in China. But I also realise that when my depression disorder reached the worst, and when the pain was most unbearable, I have no one to complain about, no one to cry out. I have to fight my mental illness. That is the biggest enemy of my life.<br>Yeah, I don’t even talk too much about my disorder, even OCD. I feel others think  I am empathetic if I talk too much , and I don’t need the sympathy from others. I do not expect others to understand my discomfort. Also thanks for experiencing the most uncomfortable times of illness, which can make me clearly realise that people must overcome tough things that must be overcome and to do something that should do. So for some experiences and bad moods in these months, I want to save myself, help myself again, and slowly come out of my past and hurt.<br>At the least, when I came to AKL alone and left home this year, I didn’t have a friend who could see my depression. Now, if you can see my words here, can you resonate with these more or less, right? </p>
<p>Although there are no people around me now, at least, I can write the mood at the moment completely in front of the screen. </p>
<p>Next year, I want to become a person who can show myself even I am alone. I want to stop hiding in the shadows and move in the direction of the sun.</p>
<hr>
<p>Even if I’m getting older, I really value the ability to love.<br>Compared with appearance, talent and perseverance, what is more precious is ‘the golden heart’.<br>In spite of persist, but still cherish and modest.<br>Always care and love others more than yourself,  as well as sensitive and exquisite at the same time.<br>have a deep empathy with others.</p>
<p>Even if my heart could be badly bruised in the future,  I  have met someone I really really like and care about  here ♥️ That’s wonderful!!!<br>Many things in life are staged, but I still hope to treat people and things in the current stage with my heart.</p>
<p>I also have a strong sense of happiness when I see the happiness and smiles of others. Of course, at the moment when I achieve my goal, and when I have done my job well. It also make me feel more energised and more confident.<br>I do not forget to be grateful and cherish the people around me. </p>
<p>I really have grown a little in the past months. is it right??🙃  Although there are times when I lose my confidence, I will definitely regain positive thinking and persistence. I want to take a new step in the next year to meet new challenges.</p>
<p>For the friends who have been watching me tenderly and support me, I really appreciate it ~</p>
<p><em>My new one-year-old:</em></p>
<p>I wanna to challenge various things, wanna go to see many unseen landscapes.</p>
<p><strong>I will not lose.</strong></p>
<p>In other words, I ’m going to think of this as a year of a winning shot.<br>And <strong>Live in the moment.</strong></p>
<p>to be a more in-depth person.<br>to be an interesting person who has depth and connotation and rich experience.<br>Let others to have thoughts to want to know more about me.</p>
<p>Want to write down clear goals here:<br>How much can be achieved in the next year?<br>• Start learning new things<br>• Meet important people more frequently🥰<br>• Continuously improve my physical ability and get in a better shape<br>• Learn a instrument</p>
<p>With high ambitions, I want to seriously meet every challenge.<br>There must be a lot of troubles next, and many things  need to be explored repeatedly.<br>also would experience more feelings that I don’t understand yet.<br>Although it must be regarded as a battle against yourself,<br>I will work hard.</p>
<p>In the emotional aspects：<br>Ah～～, always nervous.<br>Every time I want to express to you when I organise my words,<br>really really nervous<del>~</del> &gt;.&lt;<br>Although emotions don’t have the right answer, but the right thing is to pass the real thoughts in time,Isn’t it?<br>I need to be more proactive～<br><strong>I will strive to be worthy of love.</strong></p>
